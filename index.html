    <p>The city of Syracuse, an area that was once a hub of industry and manufacturing, is in decline. Approximately 38% of the population makes under $35,000 annually and 30% is estimated to live in poverty. For many, the city generally only attracts interest due to the presence of Syracuse University, an institution that is the second largest employer only after Upstate University Hospital. More recently, the area has received positive interest due to the CHIPS and Science Act which provides billions of dollars in funding for the manufacturing of semiconductor devices and led to the company Micron Technology announce their plans to build computer chip plants in a suburb of Syracuse. </p>

    <p>Despite the bursts of positive news, the city still remains a fairly dangerous place both in reality and perception. Students at Syracuse and surrounding universities such as LeMoyne College are often at risk of being burglarized and notices from Department of Public Safety officials (DPS) are a regularity. Early this September, the Syracuse police department reported an unusually high level of burglaries hitting student residences. In a conversation with Spectrum Local News, the Syracuse police chief Joe Cecile stated that his department had to reach out to state troopers for additional support. According to data released by the city of Syracuse, burglaries specifically do tend to occur during the warmer months with August of 2022 having the highest amount of burglaries in the city. </p>

    <p>Students attending SU can either report incidents of crime to DPS, the campus specific public safety office and/or the Syracuse Police Department (SPD). According to Lieutenant Smith, the two departments have an excellent relationship. “DPS and SPD officers routinely work together on various calls for service in the surrounding neighborhoods where students are involved, especially when instances of serious crimes occur” said Smith. “On the administrative level, the chiefs meet regularly to discuss issues that affect the University community. We also typically speak with members of the SPD Criminal Investigations Division a few times a week regarding ongoing investigations which affect the University community.”</p>

    <p>The relationship between the SPD and DPS is highly allied. Both share the same computer dispatching and report writing system which allows information to be highly accessible.The two departments also work together during large events and the DPS patrol commander is in charge of communication with the SPD to stop crime from occurring then. Many DPS officers including Smith himself are former Syracuse police officers and joined Syracuse University after retirement. A DPS officer is also assigned to the Center New York Regional Crime Analysis Center which allows for coordination with several New York state departments including the National Guard.</p>

    <p>Burglaries also dominate crimes that occur in the University area. In 2021, the Department of Public Safety reported a total of 18 burglaries that occurred on the main campus of Syracuse University. However, the annual report made no mention of the amount of burglaries or general crimes that occurred on South Campus. Smith states that South Campus experiences the same issues as main campus with reported crime mainly consisting of larcenies and burglaries. Residents of that section of campus may experience more incidents of crime due to the surrounding neighborhoods which, similar to the east neighborhood of Syracuse, tends to attract potential robbers.But Smith assures that DPS regularly patrols South Campus and takes extra precautions when incidents do occur.</p>

    <p>“Marked patrol units are assigned to the area 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” said Smith. “When a crime trend is noticed, such as an increase in thefts and burglaries, DPS will assign additional resources to the area.”</p>

    <p>Locals of the area or “townies” are often referred to as the cause of this issue, which Smith does not dispute. But taking responsibility can often veer into judgments that may be classist and do not acknowledge the root of the issue – unemployment. Studies have shown that crime often increases during times of unemployment and a city such as Syracuse which is thought of as “decaying” is sure to extensively suffer from those issues.</p>

    <p>Recent developments including the Micron Deal is thought to bring up to 50,000 jobs but the question is will they benefit the people in Syracuse or will they be reserved for white-collar workers who may settle into the city and heighten tensions between locals and themselves.</p>
